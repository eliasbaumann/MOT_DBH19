# MOT_DBH19
Attempt at multi-object tracking and classification for deep berlin hackathon 2019
Using https://github.com/YunYang1994/tensorflow-yolov3 as object detector because i am unable to write it myself on such short notice

# The actual challenge for my team during the hackathon was to classify image sequences

It turned out that using deep neural networks for this purpose was a bad choice as data was limited.
This code base is a mess and i will likely never open this repo again :).
